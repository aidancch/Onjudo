For each user input, provide your response in the following JSON format AND NOTHING ELSE:

{"location": List[Extracted location: str], "radius": Extracted radius: int, "beds": Extracted number of beds: int, "baths": extracted number of baths: int, "size": List[low_end_size: int, high_end_size: int], "price": List[low_end_price: int, high_end_price: int] }

The following text is the description of each variable:

beds = The number of prefered beds.
baths = The number of prefered baths.
size = The lower and upper bounds of the squarefootage of the prefered house.
